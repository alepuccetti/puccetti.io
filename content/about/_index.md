My name is Alessandro Puccetti, I am Italian :it: but I am in fact a citizen of the world :earth_americas:.
I love travelling and meeting new people from different cultures, and I enjoy having a particular focus on their food :wink:.

## What am I up to now?


I am a data engineer with a passion for automation.
One of my personal mottos is *"If you have to do it more than three times you’ve gotta automate it"*.
I currently work at **[Huq Industries](https://huq.io)** (from 2017) in London, where I manage and process hundreds of billions of geospatial events.
I am a Google Cloud Platform technologies specialist, notably of **[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)**.
At Huq Industries, I built our internal and client-facing data platforms using BigQuery as foundation
to allow us and our clients to perform **geospatial** analytics on billions of events at lighting speed.
After working hours, I like writing blogposts and giving specialized talks about cool things I do at work and about personal side projects.
You can find my blogposts on this website and on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@alepuccetti) page.
You can also find me giving talks at the [GDG Cloud London](https://www.meetup.com/gdgcloud/).

## Past Experiences

Since middle school, I have always been fascinated by computers and programming. During those years, I had my first programming experience.
I still remember starting programming in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) at my old school laboratory.
Very "basic" stuff (pun intended) :laughing:.
Lots of time has passed from that day.
In high school, I learned more about programming and computer science and I have eventually decided to follow my passion at university,
first earning my bachelor degree and then my master’s in computer engineering.
For my master thesis project, I had the amazing opportunity to attend the University of California San Diego (UCSD)
working at the Center for **[Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis](https://www.caida.org/home/)** (CAIDA) for 6 months.
There I worked on IP spoofing detection algorithms.

After my graduation, I did a 6 months research internship research at the
**[SECLAB](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/)** at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB).
There, I worked  on security and privacy in mobile applications.
One of the projects I was part of at the SecLab was then presented at the 2017 **[SECLAB](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/)** (NDSS) Symposium
under the title *"Obfuscation-Resilient Privacy Leak Detection for Mobile Apps Through Differential Analysis"*.
I have also worked as reverse and vulnerability analyst on a challenge for [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/).
During the time spent at SecLab I joined **[Shellphish](https://twitter.com/shellphish)**, its capture the flag team.
As a team member, I contributed to organizing and running the 2015 **[International Capture The Flag](https://ictf.cs.ucsb.edu/)** (iCTF)
competition and participated at **[DEFCON23](https://www.defcon.org/)** capture the flag event.

My following research experience has been at the [Internet Initiative Japan - Innovation Institute](https://www.iij-ii.co.jp/en/)(IIJ-II) (IIJ-II) in Tokyo, Japan.
There I worked on a project to securely monitor path quality.
I developed a tool to perform lightweight traffic summaries with the goal of detecting SLA violations
such as packet delay and packet drop, as well as packet alteration.
I have also participated as a volunteer at the 2015 [Internet Measurements Conference](https://www.sigcomm.org/events/imc-conference) (IMC).

In 2016, I joined [Kinvolk](http://kinvolk.io/) in Berlin working as a software developer on different open source projects
such as [rkt](https://github.com/rkt/rkt) and [systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd).
